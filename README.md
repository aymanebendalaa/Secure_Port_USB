ðŸš€ New USB Port Management Tool Completed!

Iâ€™ve just finished developing a Python script that allows dynamic management of USB ports on Windows systems. ðŸŽ‰ This tool enables users to easily enable or disable USB ports by simply entering a command like 'open' or 'close'. By modifying system registry settings, the tool ensures seamless control over USB access, providing a great way to enhance security and manage device connections, It also comes with an easy installation of the necessary requirements.

pip install -r requirements
